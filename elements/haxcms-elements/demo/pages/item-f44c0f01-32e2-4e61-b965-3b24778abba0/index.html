<p>Periodically, to get a sense both of where we can go and where we will go, we will produce "Horizon Reports". These horizon reports will come in the form of a video, discussion and image based media as far as what's possible at the time of recording, and what's possible as a result of that baseline.</p>
<p>By treating today as a baseline for tomorrow, we can build toward previously unthinkable use-cases and contexts. HAX is unique in this regard because the foundational technology is unshakable. The Web Component standard is so low level, and the web is always powered by HTML,CSS, and JavaScript, so we can build not just thinking things will work together, but knowing they will.</p>
<p>We can build not just hoping we use the same tech&#160; stack, we can confidently build forward knowing we will. Web components are a forever format that HAX is written in; and that HAX writes to as output. This ensures that HAX produced sites and pages will work forever.</p>

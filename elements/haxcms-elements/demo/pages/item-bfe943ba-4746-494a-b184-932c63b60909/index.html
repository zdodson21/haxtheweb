<p>Here are some user personas that use, develop, contribute to, and love HAX. We're always looking to refine and expand upon these, but these are some of the roles that find HAX magical.</p>

She likes to know she can and it helps inform her understanding of what HAX is doing, but would rather let a block editor do the hard work. Cat likes the way HAX lets her organize content, especially being able to "try on" a structure within a page or across multiple in order to iterate toward better content.</span><br></p></div><p slot="content"></p></accent-card>

He understands git and fundamentals of front end development, but it's not something he wants to touch every day. Chuck likes the customization he can do to HAX without having to understand every nut and bolt. He also likes that if he needs to pop the hood open on the engine, that he can and see all the parts of HAX and put that extra bit of polish on something</p></div><p slot="content"></p></accent-card>

He has to focus on his craft and doesn't have time to manage web properties. For people to see his work, he needs a basic website. He's been burned in the past by companies that hosted his material going out of business. HAX drag and drop tools and portable format allow him to easily create new spaces for his art without vendor reliance.&#60;/p&#62;"><h3 slot="heading">Meet Sven</h3><h5 slot="subheading">Artist, student without web fundamentals</h5><div slot="content"><p>Sven is a student studying to be an artist.

She also likes that she can make her own elements and themes using the CLI tools as well as publish using HAX11ty for higher SEO.&#60;/p&#62;"><h3 slot="heading">Meet Luna</h3><h5 slot="subheading">Front-end developer</h5><div slot="content"><p>Luna has written JavaScript for over a decade.

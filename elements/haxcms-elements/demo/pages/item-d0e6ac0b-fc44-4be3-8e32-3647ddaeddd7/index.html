<h4 data-original-level="H4" id="header-63ced180-69c2-778b-cfd4-f0b5c2710968"><span>Create a Compelling Introduction</span></h4>
<p>Strive to grab your students' attention in the first 30 seconds. Make your introduction
    compelling and motivate them to continue watching all the way through. Challenge
    yourself to answer the question they are asking themselves: "Why should I watch this
    video?" Avoid repeating information on your title slide that speaks for itself;
    jump right into your narrative.
    <br>
  </p>
<h4 data-original-level="H4" id="header-120422c6-2f50-915d-3744-1a751beca2e1">Increase Your Presence as the Instructor</h4>
<p>Engagement. Whether you appear onscreen in the video or narrate offscreen, you should
    personalize your lecture and foster a student connection to you as the instructor.
    Research has shown that faculty appearing onscreen alongside their content is rarely
    distracting to students and does serve to increase their engagement (although it
    does not impact retention of the content presented).
    <br>
    <br>If you prefer to remain offscreen, narrating your lecture, consider a brief onscreen
    introduction that precedes the lecture proper. This is a better approach to deliver
    the compelling introduction discussed above.</p>
<h4 data-original-level="H4" id="header-6be2bd93-adb1-8280-e931-9e3e8e0d1e92">Increase Engagement through Narrative</h4>
<p>Storytelling is an inherently powerful narrative technique. Consider recasting your
    lecture as a story, or as a collection of smaller stories woven together by big ideas.
    This is an ideal strategy to hook your students immediately and sustain their interest
    until the end of the story.&#160;
    <br>
    <br>What does an engaging narrative accomplish? What does it include?
    <br>&#8203;</p>
<ul>
    <li ="true"="">Takes students on a meaningful "mental journey" using a clear beginning, rising
      action, and a satisfying conclusion</li>
    <li ="true"="">Integrates with previous experience and knowledge</li>
    <li ="true"="">Provides examples of real world application</li>
    <li ="true"="">Poses and answers a "big question" or a "big idea"; may tell an origin story
      
    <p></p></li>
  </ul>

<h4 data-original-level="H4" id="header-2dba0319-b9e0-6867-0ffe-8ad0908a8273">Follow the Three "Don'ts"</h4>
<p>As a general principle, think of your slides as primarily visual in nature, without
    much text. The slides don't need to present your narrative; your narration is already
    doing that. That said, text does play a role, which we will explain below. First,
    though, start with these general guidelines:
    <br>
  </p>
<ul>
    <li ="true"=""><b>Don't</b>
put a significant amount of text on any of your slides</li>
    <li ="true"=""><b>Don't</b>
outline your presentation on the slides themselves; keep this in your
      notes</li>
    <li ="true"=""><b>Don't</b>
read your slide text to your students!</li>
  </ul>
<h4 data-original-level="H4" id="header-99e9a568-4c7e-e0e7-8e7f-445e84464a29">Use Bullet Points and Brief Wording</h4>
<ul>
    <li ="true"="">Use bullet points rather than complete sentences or paragraphs</li>
    <li ="true"="">Use text to reinforce or highlight key concepts and takeaways</li>
    <li ="true"="">Provide the details in the narration</li>
    <li ="true"="">Treat your slides like billboards along a highway: students should be able to take
      away the main ideas in three seconds or less</li>
  </ul>
<h4 data-original-level="H4" id="header-c46b1453-1d85-ceae-8f24-c742cf41e482">Avoid Data Dumps of Numerical Information</h4>
<p>When displaying data, avoid a "data dump". Complex tables require much effort to
    read and understand. If you need to show a comparison, split up the table into multiple
    slides, using one statistical comparison per slide.</p>
<h4 data-original-level="H4" id="header-de66dad7-4e9b-a24f-35da-e70abe5aca3a">Provide Downloadable Handouts</h4>
<p>Where more detailed text is essential, provide it in a downloadable handout. This
    frees you from the feeling that you must somehow jam that text into the slides. A
    companion handout can augment the lecture; there you can restate the key points,
    provide more detail on select topics where time was limited, give students web links,
    pose questions for reflection or submission, or provide real world application or
    case studies.</p>
<h2 data-original-level="H2" id="header-fafe4229-622b-6197-ca1b-16bb38102532" font-size="x-large" background-color="light-blue" padding-top="16" padding-bottom="16" margin-bottom="24" text-align="center" padding-left="16" data-design-treatment="bg" data-text-align="center" data-primary="15" data-padding="s" data-font-family="primary" data-font-weight="medium" data-font-size="m" data-border="lg" data-box-shadow="sm"><b>Guideline 7</b><br><span>Make visuals complement the narration, not compete.</span></h2>
<h4 data-original-level="H4" id="header-4b294505-6ca8-a0fe-0607-839ea21a3388">Avoid Unnecessary Visuals</h4>
<p><b>Important!</b>
The graphics you include on a slide should "mesh" with the narrative
    to support and enhance it. Unnecessary visuals (or text or sound) increase the cognitive
    load for students, reducing the coherence of your communication.</p>
<h4 data-original-level="H4" id="header-0462722e-f1e5-a6cd-8a6b-2eb5ca54c083">Use High-Quality Graphics</h4>
<p>Use high-quality graphics that are readily understood (not marred by distortion,
    pixelation, or low resolution).</p>
<h4 data-original-level="H4" id="header-bd2103fc-3952-01f4-7c7a-8302818b5821">Avoid Text-Dense Graphics</h4>
<p>Graphics should not be word-heavy or complex in structure. Just as with presenting
    data, use multiple slides to walk through more complex structures.</p>
<h2 data-original-level="H2" id="header-fafe4229-622b-6197-ca1b-16bb38102532" background-color="light-blue" padding-top="16" padding-bottom="16" font-size="x-large" margin-bottom="24" text-align="left" padding-left="16" data-design-treatment="bg" data-primary="15" data-text-align="center" data-padding="s" data-font-family="primary" data-font-weight="medium" data-font-size="m" data-border="lg" data-box-shadow="sm"><b>Guideline 8</b><br><span>Use animations and “building” slides appropriately.</span></h2>
<h4 data-original-level="H4" id="header-9ec49f0a-57af-cba6-a380-ab149a60e8a1">When a Built-Up Slide is Appropriate</h4>
<p>Animations or building slides work well with conveying processes, comparisons, and
    more detailed information.</p>
<ul>
    <li ="true"="">Slides with many labels (like a diagram) are suited to a build-up approach</li>
    <li ="true"="">Simple tables (like a matrix for comparison) are suited to a build-up approach</li>
      <li ="true"="">Multi-stage processes benefit from a building display</li>
        <li ="true"="">Slides with a greater amount of text should build in stages to prevent students
          from reading ahead</li>
  </ul>
<p>Students who read ahead increase their distraction and cognitive load and may not
    attend to narration properly.</p>
<h4 data-original-level="H4" id="header-148c6532-757a-888d-a9f5-13246cde1478">Reserve Animation for Visuals Best Understood in Motion</h4>
<p>Avoid "catchy" animations that merely serve to display or erase information, or
    transition between slides. These effects add nothing to the content presented, and
    serve to distract students by adding to their cognitive load.</p>
<h2 data-original-level="H2" id="header-fafe4229-622b-6197-ca1b-16bb38102532" font-size="x-large" background-color="light-blue" padding-top="16" padding-bottom="16" margin-bottom="24" text-align="left" padding-left="16" data-design-treatment="bg" data-primary="15" data-padding="s" data-font-family="primary" data-font-weight="medium" data-font-size="m" data-border="lg" data-box-shadow="sm" data-text-align="center"><b>Guideline 9</b><br>Synchronize Information Display with Narration.</h2>
<p>Synchronize the display of text and images that you are referencing with your mention
    of them in your narration. The moment that you say it is the moment they see it.
    Research shows that coordinating the auditory and visual elements reduces student
    cognitive load and helps them focus on your content.</p>
<h2 data-original-level="H2" id="header-fafe4229-622b-6197-ca1b-16bb38102532" background-color="light-blue" padding-top="16" padding-bottom="16" font-size="x-large" margin-bottom="24" text-align="left" padding-left="16" data-design-treatment="bg" data-primary="15" data-text-align="center" data-padding="s" data-font-family="primary" data-font-weight="medium" data-font-size="m" data-border="lg" data-box-shadow="sm"><b>Guideline 10</b><br><span>Maximize the video lecture’s shelf life.</span></h2>
<h4 data-original-level="H4" id="header-f2aec77f-fc15-169d-9e4a-7b0d73a87363">Avoid Dated References</h4>
<p>Avoid including information in the video that will unnecessarily date the lecture
    content, such as time and date references ("this week", "October 9th", "last year").
    Dates and times will be maintained as textual information in the web page itself
    where they can be kept current.</p>
<h4 data-original-level="H4" id="header-cf9a64e3-1269-d8d6-bbed-560c4e9f8753">Reference Other Lectures by Name</h4>
<p>If you need to reference another lecture in your narration, be sure to refer to
    it by title, not by sequence ("the previous lecture") or an associated number ("the
    Lesson 3 lecture"). Most courses are revised at some point, and numbered or sequential
    references may not remain accurate. Also, remember that students may view lectures
    out of&#160;sequence.</p>
<h4 data-original-level="H4" id="header-5a37f4ab-d68c-d1d2-8e1a-4067c7a9fb96">Website Links and References</h4>
<p>You may include "tours" of relevant informational websites, web-based application
    demonstrations, or desktop-based tools. Examples include showing students how to
    use a set of features in a digital design tool, or touring students through a virtual
    museum.
    <br>
    <br>Just remember that software interfaces change and websites change in content, structure,
    and location. A heavy reliance on a particular application will require frequent
    updating of video (whether your own or a third party) as new versions are released.
    <br>
      <br>Should you wish to encourage students to explore sites you have shown, provide the
      links in the webpage (rather than referencing them in the video itself). There you
      can write a brief description of the site and why students should explore it.</p>

<p>Absolutely! The HAX.cloud network is just there to help with sustainability of small sites and aid in rapid publishing and distribution of HAX sites. The magic script which powers all HAX sites lives with the site itself and fails over to the CDN only after checking for a local copy of assets.</p>

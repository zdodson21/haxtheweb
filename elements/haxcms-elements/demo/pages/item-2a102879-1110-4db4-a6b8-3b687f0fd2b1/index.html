<p>Installation and management of HAXiam have scripts to help with their setup just like other parts of the HAX ecosystem</p>
<h2 data-original-level="H2" id="header-ee72b742-e7ed-6967-8aa5-c770fde047c8">Installation</h2>
<ul><li>To install dependencies on the server to ensure smooth setup, <a href="https://github.com/haxtheweb/HAXiam/blob/master/scripts/ubuntu20.04.sh" target="_blank">this ubuntu configuration script is provided</a></li><li>Installing HAXiam involves this script: <a href="https://github.com/haxtheweb/HAXiam/blob/master/scripts/whateveryousayiam.sh" target="_blank" role="textbox">iamwhateveryousayiam.sh</a></li></ul>
<h2 data-original-level="H2" id="header-a65735d0-21c3-8e35-7d03-410154579908">Vanity domains</h2>
<p>HAXiam allows for empowering users to create sites but in order to ensure they don't step on each other's namespaces, addresses can get kind of long. This is by design to support a multi-tenant environment for building the site, but often is annoying when sharing addresses out to others. That's where vanity domains come in, though they require server configuration.</p>
<ul><li>Create a valid Apache record for the domain in a <code>VirtualHost</code> block as to where in the file system to point for this domain</li><li>Include the following environmental variable in the <code>VirtualHost</code> definition: <code>SetEnv HAXSITE_BASE_URL /</code></li><li>Where <code>/</code> is the base path seen in the URL when accessing the root of the site. <code>/</code> will be the most common for this when doing something like <code>example.com</code> pointing to a site within a HAXiam instance</li></ul>
<p>The&#160;<i>HAXSITE_BASE_URL</i> variable is required to help the front-end resolve where the <code>&lt;base&gt;</code> tag is going to be resolving to. This configuration allows HAXiam to manage the path for viewing and authorship, while at the same time helping the <abbr title="Progressive Web Application">PWA</abbr> nature of HAXsite still be able to resolve where the files are for the site no matter the URL.</p>
<h2 data-original-level="H2" id="header-31d4513c-39c8-ac52-bdc2-32c59cfa3898">Authentication providers / Customization</h2>
<p>Both HAXiam as well as HAXcms can have customization applied to HAXiam's configure directory in order to ensure maintainable upgrades of both the core platform as well as HAXcms which it is managing a copy of.</p>
<p>Example implementations of these files are written into <a href="https://github.com/haxtheweb/HAXiam/tree/master/system/boilerplate/systemsetup" target="_blank">new instances at the time the system is created and can be found here.</a></p>

<p><b>Welcome to the Gallery! </b>Here you will find (eventually) a host of instructional resources created for faculty course authors. <b>YOU</b> have questions, like "What makes faculty-created videos instructionally effective?" <b>WE</b> are providing answers based on solid educational research and evidence-based best practice. To answer the question, we don't merely rehash the findings; instead, we show how our faculty have exemplified best practice in their own work.&#160;<br><br>Choose a gallery below to explore.</p>

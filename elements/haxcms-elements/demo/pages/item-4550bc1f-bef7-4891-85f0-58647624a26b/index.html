<p>Web content authoring solutions are a mix of trade offs, training and fragmented experiences for people putting their voice on the web. HAX changes the game, by fully integrating design capabilities with what someone is creating. Unlike traditional WYSIWY(A)G (what you see is what you <i>almost </i>get). HAX is a <b>1:1</b> between <i>what you are editing</i>, <i>where you are editing</i>, and <i><b>what you see</b></i> when you hit Save!</p>

<p>It can be both! The web content editing piece of HAX, while part of the HAXcms platform, can be leveraged stand alone in any other CMS. Current <a href="documentation/haxcms" role="textbox">CMSs that that supported integrations</a> can be found in our documentation section.</p>

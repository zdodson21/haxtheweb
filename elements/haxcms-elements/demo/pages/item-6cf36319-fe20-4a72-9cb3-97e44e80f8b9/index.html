It does this through methodology, low level platform APIs, leveraging micro-services, and lazy loading expensive assets as needed. Performance is not a nice to have. It is access, it is usability, it is not a feature but a core ideal.</p><p slot="col-1" role="textbox">Much like accessibility, when we don't think of the bytes we send, we are discriminating against those with slow devices or low quality internet connections. This leaves people out of the conversation and reduces access to information.</p><un-sdg goal="7" slot="col-2" loading="lazy" fetchpriority="low"></un-sdg>

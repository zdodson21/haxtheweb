<p>While not exclusively created by Penn State, this is a flow chart attempting to explain decision making of when something gets into the platform. This is a Penn State centric version as many of "can we release this" style questions will stem from the founder of the platform. As much as possible it is the goal to release everything related to the project so there is minimal secret sauce in the HAX [dot] PSU platform (powering this site).</p>

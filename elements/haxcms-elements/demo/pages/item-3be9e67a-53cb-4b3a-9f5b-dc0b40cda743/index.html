<p>The HAX "App Store" API is a basic json specification that provides the directions to HAX on what blocks and integrations it has access to. It has three key aspects</p>
<ul><li>Apps - Apps provide either places HAX can upload / save data or places that HAX can search and present data from. Common examples are the file system it is currently located on, NASA, wikipedia, Youtube and more. Apps bring media to HAX or save it with the HAXsite.</li><li>Stax - reusable templates of pre-assembled blocks. Think of this like a full page or part of a page layout that when selecting the user adds multiple blocks with a set configuration.</li><li>Autoloader - The autoloader property is an object that stores the name of a valid tag =&gt; bare import location of that tag. The HAX schema is read off of these file references when the editor loads. This automatic loading process teaches HAX how and what it can edit.</li></ul>
<p>An <a href="https://github.com/haxtheweb/webcomponents/blob/master/elements/h-a-x/demo/appstore.json" target="_blank">example of appstore.json can be found here</a> and is the basis for HAX integrations into the various CMSs and solutions it provides.</p>

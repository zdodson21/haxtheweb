<p>A 2013 research study in mathematics compared the test performance of two groups
  of students. The first group answered questions posed between video lecture "chunks"
  of approximately 5 minutes in length. The second group completed unrelated arithmetic
  problems between the same video segments. This research showed the students in the
  first group performed significantly better on subsequent tests of the material compared
  to the second group. These students also reported less mind wandering, exhibited
  increased note taking, described the learning as less &#8220;mentally taxing,&#8221; and reported
  reduced test anxiety.</p>
<p>Why does this strategy of "interjected questions" work?</p>
<ul><li>It optimizes cognitive load by:</li><ul><li>Decreasing extraneous load (i.e., anxiety about an upcoming test)</li><li>Increasing germane load (i.e., note taking, reduced mind wandering)</li></ul><li>It taps into the “testing effect” by prompting students to recall important information; this strengthens memorization and increases their ability to apply and use what has been learned​</li><li>It helps students engage in more accurate self-assessment.</li></ul>
<p>HAX now supports a variety of question formats you can use to apply this guideline. The emphasis here is not on performance (it isn't a test), but on helping students to realize what they do and do not know. Feedback statements should guide the student to <i>find</i> the correct answers themselves, rather than simply stating them.</p>

<p>Earlier research (2006)&#160;in a computer science course&#160;compared the impact of interactive versus non-interactive video on student learning.<br><br>Students in the interactive group were able to control movement through the video, selecting important sections
  to review and moving backward when desired.&#160; This group demonstrated better achievement of learning
  outcomes and greater satisfaction than the non-interactive group. <br><br>An easy way to provide this kind of navigational interactivity
  is to use Kaltura (or another tool) to associate labeled &#8220;chapters&#8221; with a video. For example, if a video teaches three topics, students can click entries in a topic menu to jump immediately to the start of Topic 1, 2, or 3. Not only does this give students navigational control, but it makes the instructor's content organization readily apparent, which benefits students by increasing the germane load of the lesson.</p>

<p>One research study examined the impact of guiding questions on student learning
  from video. Students in some course sections watched a video without receiving any additional instructions, while students in other
  sections were provided with eight guiding questions to consider and answer while
  watching. Those students who answered the guiding questions scored significantly higher on a subsequent test than the other group.<br><br>Research has shown that posing guiding questions in reading assignments increases student learning. This strategy translates effectively to video. By focusing student attention on important elements, guiding questions increase the germane load
  of the learning task while reducing the extraneous load. While students may not recognize themselves what is necessary to achieve the stated learning objectives, guiding questions can effectively signal&#160;important insights and understandings.<br></p>

<p>Ultimately, we want students to be able to perform tasks that demonstrate real understanding of what they have learned, or some degree of skill enabling them to reach a desired result. The time comes to put learning to the test.<br><br>Research has shown that the videos that offer the greatest benefit to students are those highly relevant to an associated assessment. This can range from a series of questions to answer or concepts to apply, on through to more complex assignments and projects.<br><br>Students value videos that clarify difficult concepts they will later need to apply, or that break the impasse of idea generation needed to start creative assignments, or demonstrate better use of software tools and techniques for greater efficiency in problem solving. Students can more easily see the value of video-based content that equips them to perform better and earn higher grades.<br></p>

<p>In a word. <b>Ubiquity</b>. The ability to be creative on the web with modern authoring tools and not ever stop and think how you'll get that information there. How long will it work? What if we have to move it?</p>
<p><b>The web needs a file format</b> like jpg, gif, png, html, or xml. I should be able to give you a website as a single directory and it <i>Just Works</i>&#8482;. I shouldn't need to know how it was built to edit it. The editor need just appear, be pervasive and embedded in the things we wish to be creative with on the web. HAX is more than just an authoring experience; it's a way to simplify the broadcast of creativity on the web.</p>
<h2 data-original-level="H2" id="header-0a340992-6bd7-019e-ef43-be87ac585a5a">A new way of authoring</h2>
<p>Write HTML without knowing it, HAX is here to transform web publishing. Watch why HAX is different than past CMS solutions as well as pillars of development and where the platform is now.</p>

<p>HAX stands for "<b>H</b>eadless <b>A</b>uthoring e<b>X</b>perience" which is a development philosophy focused on each word and it's impact for the solution we build.</p>
<h2 data-original-level="H2" id="header-a078f1cd-fa0f-72e7-48bd-0b19f54d5d62">An ecosystem mindset</h2>
<p>HAX is an ecosystem of blocks, templates, platforms and web tools in order allow for a ubiquitous web ecosystem. This can be difficult to envision, but here's a picture of many of the tools and concepts in our ecosystem and their interplay.</p>

<h3 data-original-level="H3" id="header-fbade326-3686-48de-78e8-f26a751497b5">Headless</h3>
<p>Headless is a common phrase in modern front-end web development. Without getting too technical up front, imagine that traditional web solutions are built as a single location solution. They require things you see on your screen right now but also are highly tied to "back-end" software that makes the experience work for you.</p>
<p>Headless means that the focus of HAX is on the front-end web user experience only. It has very little if any tie to a "back-end".&#160;<span>This design constraint forces the development community to build the tool in such a way that it's highly portable to any environment, fast, small, and easy to maintain.</span></p>
<h3 data-original-level="H3" id="header-21ba0126-6371-baef-b617-3602691a7241">Authoring</h3>
<p>The focus of HAX is on the author, specifically, content authors. Traditional Content management system (CMS) environments focus on management of content. The organization, storage, retrieval, and presentation of material are paramount to the way in which authors actually work with the solution.</p>
<p>By focusing on authors directly we are able to craft solutions that better meet the needs of users that know how to open up a text editor and start writing. HAX blocks and editing tools are engineered to empower authors because the management and storage of material are semantic, simple, and portable.</p>
<h3 data-original-level="H3" id="header-6170e9da-75d6-83ec-27e6-7166fecad6b5">eXperience</h3>
<p>The experience you have while using any system makes or breaks what you will create with the tool. By focusing on user experience, especially authoring experience as to how content creators implement and present content, we're able to provide the highest quality experience possible.</p>
<p>HAX core audience is focused on people that know the internet exists but not how it works. As a result HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are pushed to the background. While everything you write in HAX is made of these technologies you shouldn't have to know anything about them in order to be creative on the web.</p>
<h3 data-original-level="H3" id="header-5aa7998b-4267-361a-b1cf-6c702ed3efb6">Go forth and web</h3>
<p>From here, it's up to you to build the best web you can. We hope you enjoy <b>HAX</b>

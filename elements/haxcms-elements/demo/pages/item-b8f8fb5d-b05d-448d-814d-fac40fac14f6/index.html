<p><b>What is an ontology?</b>
 For our purposes, it is a visual analysis of the essential and desirable elements of a course, and how those elements relate to one another. </p>

<h2 data-original-level="H2" id="header-e1fc873f-5f94-8d6b-560f-b542e50244f3"><span>Why define an ontology for HAX?</span></h2>
<ul><li><b>End user support.</b>
 In order for HAX to provide course authoring assistance at the point of need, an underlying ontology must be operative for tagging and pulling in associated guidance and examples.<b></b>
</li>
<li><b>Enabling dialog and progress.</b>
 For HAX to continuously improve, course authors, instructional designers, and developers need to speak a common vocabulary and would benefit from a shared mental model of a course.â€‹</li>
<li><b>Gap analysis.</b>
 Once we can specify the instructional tool set already provided in HAX, we can more easily determine instructional capabilities we are missing.</li>
</ul>
<h2 data-original-level="H2" id="header-9f645a2d-ab8c-8afd-8f53-43d3de1fd263"><span>What should characterize the ontology?</span></h2>
<ul><li><strong>Research-informed best practice.</strong>
 The ontology should be driven by evidence-based teaching and learning strategies and illustrated by annotated examples taken from actual ODL courses.</li>
<li><strong>Stability supporting growth.</strong>
 The ontology should be robust, yet capable of organic growth over time; that is, logical enough to serve as a stable foundation, while able to adapt, broaden, and deepen.</li>
<li><strong>Empowering.</strong>
 The ontology should permit complete flexibility in the instructional approach used, while also serving to showcase the application of recognized approaches such as Backward Design.</li>
</ul>

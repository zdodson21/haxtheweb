<p>Merlin is the HAX command system to perform anything from knowing what you can insert, searching youtube, asking questions or <a href="https://github.com/elmsln/issues/issues" target="_blank">even submitting issues to improve HAX</a>

<p role="textbox">On behalf of the entire HAX community we hope you enjoy your experience building content with us. If you want to help influence the future of the project, we have monthly on-campus user group meetings for instructional designers and developers and bi-monthly meetings for our faculty and student community to offer feedback and help shape the future of the platform.</p>

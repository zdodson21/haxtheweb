<p>HAX seeks to empower as many people as possible through a non-traditional worldview with regard to accessibility (a11y). When we say <abbr role="textbox" title="accessibility">a11y</abbr><span>, we mean access to everyone, everywhere, regardless of ability either physical ability, technical ability, or device capability.</span></p>
<p>HAX a11y principles:</p>
<ul><li>Use the minimal amount of resources (see <a href="pledges/environmental-impact" data-uuid="item-edcd6f86-05b5-43a9-8766-8a56709451c8" role="textbox" style="background-color: var(--simple-colors-default-theme-light-green-1); color: var(--simple-colors-default-theme-light-green-12);" background-color="light-green">Environmental impact</a>
) required to deliver experiences in order to use less resources at a distance</li>
<li>ensure that HAX itself meets WCAG 2.0 AA compliance standards</li>
<li>Ensure that, within reason, HAX enforces and automatically eliminates considerations of writing web code that could lead to web accessibility errors</li>
<li>Leverage accessible, audited base classes to ensure uniformity visually and non-visually to all blocks created <i><b>with or for</b>
</i>
 HAX</li>
</ul>

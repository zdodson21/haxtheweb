<p>HAX is many things to many people. This is our best attempt to the roadmap for 2025. It is vision statement with where we are going based on where we have been and are as of the beginning of the year (Jan 14<sup>th</sup> 2025). This is subject to change and enhancement but should signal where we are going on this rocket ship.&#160;ðŸš€</p>

<ul><li>DDD Theme and palette stabilization</li><ul><li>Normalizing "Simple Colors" 2019-2023 color work with DDD color work 2024+</li><li>Ability to palette templates and establishment of multiple palettes</li><li>Audit of what can and can not be colorized as well as templates that force opinions on colorization across the site (palette-ing without the ability to modify, much like the Invent theme)</li><li>Terminology update from "theme" to "template" and palettes being color palettes that can be applied to a template (referred to as a theme from now on)</li><li>Support for sub-templat-ing in theme development from a developer perspective</li></ul><li>Use Case / Skeleton</li><ul><li>Updating the HAXcms 8-bit overworld to go from "Start new Journey" so that when clicked it goes to a searchable dashboard of use-cases. Those use-cases will allow people to quickly demo things using the site recipe specification (hax CLI commands strung together as a file)</li><li>Use case work will require hax cli to be enhanced to support recipe files</li><li>playground will need enhanced to support recipe files being played to build new sites from remote scripts</li><li>Use case submission workflow so that people can submit their own recipe files in order to share directives for how starting points are made</li><li>HAXiam / HAXcms support for loading use-cases off of the config directory</li></ul><li>CLI Work for Template / Theme development and developer operations</li><ul><li>DX improvements and workflows to allow simple, scriptable methods of generating new sites with custom templates / themes</li><li>Tutorials / documentation on how to make new templates</li><li>Ability to capture and 'play' recipes (with or without custom themes) so that Use cases / Skeletons are possible to be captured by using hax to make new sites</li><li>Integration of theme development into projects for EdTechJoker pipeline</li></ul><li>Internal migrations / standardization / private space support</li><ul><li>HAX is leveraged across hax.psu and multiple ELMS:LN instances.</li><li>Naming conventions need standardized so that HAXiam can better support and sustain growth in the community internal and external to A&amp;A (core development team)</li><li>This will lead to better spaces for showcasing OER content made by HAX as well as support for secure / authentication required spaces</li></ul><li>HAX.ai</li><ul role="textbox"><li>GPT-like conversational interface for asking an agent to build sites which it then turns language into commands and executes those commands in a webcontainer</li><li>Chat Agent services for asking questions about content like a digital tutor</li><li>Auto-complete services for writing where hax will complete the paragraph you are writing or generating media based on AI prompted asks directly in context of writing / working</li></ul></ul>

<p>While HAX can be used to build many types of websites, it's original use-cases were in instruction and online course / textbook development. As a result, a lot of the decisions around how and why the system works as it does are grounded in instructional design and pedagogical design.</p>
<p>As a result, we have our <a href="ontology" role="textbox">HAX Ontology</a> which is the justification for our foundational decision making around the project and how it fits together at an instructional level.</p>
<p>We also have the <a href="the-gallery-of-online-excellence">Gallery of Online Excellence</a> which illustrates how HAX can help you teach more effectively.</p>

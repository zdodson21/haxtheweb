<p role="textbox">HAX gets it's name from "Headless Authoring eXperience" which is a technical concept implying that it works anywhere. Headless, anywhere, disconnected from a server. Author - you! HAX is centered on content creators. And eXperience. Many systems talk about "Developer experience" or "User experience" well, our community works tirelessly to make authoring on the web no different than working in any other space. If something exists it should be easy to create and be done in a format that will work forever, is fast, easy to use, engaging, educational, and work regardless of what future technical winds blow.</p>
<p>HAX is maintained through a collaboration between Penn State's College of Arts &#38; Architecture, Eberly College of Science, and Information Sciences and Technology. Engineers, students, faculty, instructional designers, graphic artists all working together to design the future of authoring. Let's check out how it works!</p>

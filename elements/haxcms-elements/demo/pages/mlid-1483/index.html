<p>Bridges designed by the Spanish/Swiss architect/engineer Santiago Calatrava embody a radical innovation in bridge design. Seemingly out of nowhere, this model of bridge has become hugely popular for anyone who wants a new bridge. Clearly, some aspect of creative thinking must be involved in the way that he shifted the paradigm of bridge design. But equally important is the role of critical thinking in assessing what you&#8217;ve done after you&#8217;ve done it. &#160;</p>

<p>In this design story, we&#8217;ll first ask the questions of what is going on with Calatrava&#8217;s bridges&#8230;.</p>

<hr/><p>Take a few moments to consider the questions posed and reflect on them. How does this innovation in bridge design tie to creative thinking? What might be going on that led Calatrava to such new ideas? And, how might becoming aware of it (
  <em>hello, critical thinking!</em>
) help to focus the direction that Calatrava found himself returning to time and again?

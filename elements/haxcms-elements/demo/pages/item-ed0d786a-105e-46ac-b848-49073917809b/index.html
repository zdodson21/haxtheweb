<p>To know who you are, you have to know where you've been. HAX is born out of a decade of work around making it easier for faculty, students and staff to be creative with online materials and more easily structure them. While we don't use the original code of these efforts, it informed the world view that goes into HAX as a future vehicle for empowering human creativity on the internet while reducing costs and energy used in order to do that empowering.</p>

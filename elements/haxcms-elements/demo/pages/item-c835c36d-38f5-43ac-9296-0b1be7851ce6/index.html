<p>Developing for HAX itself or leveraging it's tools? There's a lot going on in our ecosystem so <a href="https://github.com/haxtheweb/issues/issues" target="_blank">if we miss something let us know</a>!</p>
<h2 data-original-level="H2" id="h2-700688603">Contribute webcomponents repo</h2>
<p>The HAX monorepo has all 500+ blocks in the HAX ecosystem, as well as the editor, site and CMS (front-end) aspects of the system. If contributing to ANYTHING front-end focused, it will be through this repository. General contribution workflow:</p>
<ul><li>Fork the <a href="https://github.com/haxtheweb/webcomponents" target="_blank">haxtheweb/webcomponents monorepo</a></li><li><code>yarn install</code></li><li>to work on HAX as a while, run <code>yarn run hax</code> from the project root</li><li>to work on an individual element, <code>cd elements/element-name</code> and then run <code>yarn run start</code></li><li>Make your changes, commit, push up and then open a PR against the main repo</li></ul>
<h2 data-original-level="H2" id="h2--1597356500">Create my own web components</h2>
<p>The <a href="documentation/developers/tools/create" target="_blank">HAX CLI</a> is the best way to accomplish this. It leverages Lit + OpenWC recommendations for building new web components that can easily be published on npm. It also has boilerplate that makes it easier to build blocks that visually look like the HAX ecosystem (via <a href="documentation/hax-frontend-devs/implementing-ddd">DDD</a>) and also ways of creating stand alone HAXsite's and workflows for building custom themes and elements for the ecosystem.</p>

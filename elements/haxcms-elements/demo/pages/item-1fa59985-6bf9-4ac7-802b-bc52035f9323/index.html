<p>HAXsite is what you are viewing currently. It is a single site that can operate stand alone or in the larger HAXcms context. A site has everything it needs to function by itself on the front-end. The HAXcms backend comes in to make the files writable.</p>
<p>Treating the site like it is a self-contained folder / file format allows for HAX to achieve it's primary goal of being a ubiquitous web authoring platform. This is because everything needed to power the site lives within the folder the site resides in. The "database" structure is handled by the <code>site.json</code> file powering the site, the content of the pages live under <code>/pages/</code> and the template leveraged for the site's design comes from the same web component infrastructure as the blocks that make up the page.</p>
<h2 id="header-9d55b4f1-edb4-4e1d-565f-d68f66793958">What's in a site?</h2>
<p>The key directories / files include:</p>
<ul><li><code>custom/</code> - customized build routines for including files locally or custom theme work</li><li><code>files/</code> - any files you've uploaded through the HAX interface</li><li><code>pages/</code> - folders named by their content uri that have index.html in it, no structure other then what you created when hitting save</li><li><code>site.json</code> - JSON Outline Schema object that defines the pages in your site and their relationship to each other</li><li>build.js - magic script that ensures the site loads either off local files or the CDN network to keep it online</li><li>build-haxcms.js - enhancements to magic script specific to haxcms platform</li><li>ims* - files related to the SCORM standard to allow the folder to be zipped and unzipped into LMS environments</li><li>index.html - front page for the PWA if installed on a non-php based environment</li><li>config.php - brokers on php based environments if HAXcms is there to preload content or if the site is operating stand alone (in which case it loads a slim version of HAXcms)</li><li>index.php - php based environment entryway that preloads content and optimizes for 1st load in headers</li><li>lunrSearchIndex.json - lunr powers the search widgets commonly used in HAX themes. This index is rebuilt when pages are saved and allows for searching in a way that works statically.</li><li>manifest.json - makes it a PWA, no need to edit this file it will build dynamically based on site settings being saved.</li><li>netlify.toml - built in support for netlify publishing</li><li>package.json - dependencies for editing the site locally; namely just invoking npx @haxtheweb/haxcms-nodejs</li><li>push-manifest.json - optimizations for some hosting environments to push site.json and index.html prior to request</li><li>robots.txt - SEO what search engines should look in as well as ignore</li><li>rss.xml - built per site save, RSS feed of the site</li><li>service-worker.js - makes it a PWA, no need to edit this</li><li>web-dev-server.haxcms.config.cjs - helper file for local development / serving work</li></ul>

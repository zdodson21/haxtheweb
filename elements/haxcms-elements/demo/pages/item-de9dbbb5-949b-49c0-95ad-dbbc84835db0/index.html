<p><b>Definition:</b> Signaling, also known as cueing, is the use of on-screen text
  or symbols to highlight important information. Signaling helps the student by drawing
  attention to information of particular importance in the narrative.</p>
<p><b>Examples:</b>

</p>
<ul>
  <li>Text display of key words spoken in the narrative</li>
  <li>Changes in color or contrast for text and graphics already onscreen</li>
  <li>Visual augmentation by adding shapes, symbols, or pointers to a region of the screen</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Why it works:</b>&#160;"By highlighting the key information, signaling helps
  direct learner attention, thus targeting particular elements of the video for processing
  in the working memory."</p>
<p><b>Implications for learning:</b>&#160;Compared with more advanced learners, novice
  learners value increased signaling from the instructor. They possess far less ability
  at this stage to discriminate between essential and less-essential lecture content,
  so strong and clear signaling is especially helpful to them.
  <br>
  <br>Effective signaling serves to increase germane load by emphasizing the organization
  of (and connections within) the information presented. At the same time, it reduces
  extraneous load by eliminating the ongoing inner dialog of, "How important
  is this relative to everything else?" The author notes that researchers have shown
  that signaling also improves retention and knowledge transfer.</p>

<p><b>Definition:</b>&#160;Segmenting is simply the chunking of information in a video
  lesson. Rather than present a large amount of information in a single video, the
  content is segmented into a series of shorter videos.
  <br>
</p>
<p><b>How to do it:</b>

</p>
<ul>
  <li>Reduce the length of videos by breaking them into a series of logical topics</li>
  <li>Include "click to move forward" pauses within a video to pose questions for reflection (using tools like YouTube Annotate or HapYak)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Why it works:</b> Segmenting allows learners to engage with smaller, more manageable pieces of new information, and gives them control over the flow of new information.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Implications for learning: </b>Helps students cope with intrinsic load and can
  also increase germane load by emphasizing the structure of the information.</p>

  <br>Use <i>w<span>eeding</span></i><i></i> to eliminate extraneous information.
  <br>
  </h2>
<p><b>Definition:</b> Weeding is the elimination of interesting but extraneous information
    that does not contribute to the learning goal. Unnecessary information&#160;serves
    to overload working memory, increase extraneous load, and hinder learning.<br></p>
<p><b>Examples:</b></p>
<ul><li>Text, graphics, or narration that is "nice to know" but not "need to know"</li><li>Background music</li><li>Complex slide backgrounds <li="true"="" style="font-family: var(--ddd-font-primary); font-size: var(--ddd-theme-body-font-size); caret-color: var(--hax-ui-caret-color, auto);">Anything "extra" that requires the student to judge whether he or she should be paying attention to it</li="true"=""></li></ul>
<ul>
    
  </ul>
<p><b>Implications for learning design:</b>&#160;Although weeding is beneficial to
    every learner, it should be performed carefully, informed by the student level of
    expertise (truly novice learners in a subject domain versus more advanced students).
    <br>
    <br>"Importantly, information that increases extraneous load changes as the learner
    moves from novice toward expert status. That is, information that may be extraneous
    for a novice learner may actually be helpful for a more expert-like learner, while
    information that is essential for a novice may serve as an already known distraction
    for an expert."
    <br>
    <br>The goal is to include information necessary for cognitive processing, while eliminating
    information not needed to reach the learning goal.&#160;The author notes that researchers
    have shown that weeding also improves retention and knowledge transfer.

<p><b>Definition:</b>&#160;Matching modality (see Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning) refers
    to a strategy for optimizing the function of working memory to increase learning.&#160;Matching
    modality means that we&#160;fit the type of information best suited to the most appropriate
    channel, narrative information&#160;supplied via the audio/verbal channel, and visual
    information supplied via&#160;the visual/pictorial channel.
    <br>
    <br><b>Example:</b> Teaching a process by showing an animation while simultaneously narrating
    your commentary.&#160;This approach&#160;uses both channels to explain the process,
    with the learner receiving&#160;complementary streams of information, neither of
    which overloads the limits of working memory.
    <br>
    <br><b>Non-example:</b> Showing the same animation while simultaneously displaying textual
    commentary on screen. This approach neglects the audio/verbal channel entirely while
    overloading the visual/pictorial channel; this overtaxes working memory and impairs
    learning.
    <br>
    <br><b>Implications for learning:</b>&#160;Matching modality properly allows instructors
    to enhance the germane load of a learning experience. This serves to increase a student's
    lecture engagement, information retention, and ability to transfer information.&#160;</p>

<p>Since your voice is a student's primary connection to the content, strive for the
    highest quality audio possible. Use a speaking style that is professional, but also
    personable and relatable. Imagine that you are speaking to someone at a social event,
    where you would likely use conversational language rather than academic language.
    <br>
      <br>Make it personal. Illustrate using firsthand stories, real world examples, and points
      of interest you feel especially passionate about.
      <br>

<p>Reading your slide content aloud while your students are trying to read it on screen
    makes that task more difficult for them. From your earlier scripting, you will be
    speaking <i>about</i>
what is on the screen rather than reading it <i>verbatim</i>
.

<p>This one takes many by surprise when encountering it for the first time!&#160; Presenting
    to a camera or your computer screen will feel very different from presenting to a
    live audience. Without the students, you lack the non-verbal cues and sense of connection
    that you experience in the classroom.</p>
<h4 data-original-level="H4" id="header-978a1f94-ffef-aa7c-0352-15f148f3e179" background-color="orange" padding-top="8" padding-bottom="8" padding-right="8" padding-left="8"><b>Audio Levels and Quality</b></h4>
<p>Since your narration is the primary instructional vehicle in a lecture, it is important
    that the audio be high quality, clear, free of distractions, and playing back at
    a strong and consistent volume level. ODL can provide you with a&#160;quality external
    microphone for use in our studio or your office. <b>The quality of microphone is the most important factor in recording.</b>

    <br>
      <br>Take time to experiment a bit before launching into recording. Use an application
      (we like Audacity) that shows you the recording levels. You can easily see when the
      input sensitivity is too high: the levels bounce into the red and remain there, and
      you can begin to hear sound distortion.&#160;You can also see when the input sensitivity
      is too low: the levels never make it out of the green (even momentarily), and the
      sounds lacks "oomph". Either result is frustrating to listen to.
      <br>
      <br>Once you have good levels, you don't need to set them again. Just maintain the same
      physical distance from the mic and spot check your levels occasionally. <b>One last tip: after recording, use the software's normalize feature</b>
to
      normalize your final audio to a consistent benchmark level. Regardless of variations
      in level during recording, this will make them all consistent in the end.</p>

<p>Avoid wearing clothing that is highly reflective, or that has tight or high-contrast
      patterns. As a general rule, wear neutral, solid colors.</p>
<h4 data-original-level="H4" id="header-978a1f94-ffef-aa7c-0352-15f148f3e179" background-color="blue-grey" padding-top="8" padding-bottom="8" padding-right="8" padding-left="8">Avoid Distracting Audio</h4>
<p>If you are using a lapel mic, eliminate any rustling sounds from clothing or jewelry.</p>
<h4 data-original-level="H4" id="header-978a1f94-ffef-aa7c-0352-15f148f3e179" background-color="blue-grey" padding-top="8" padding-bottom="8" padding-right="8" padding-left="8">Consider Your Background and Environment</h4>
<p>We also want to minimize student distractions stemming from the background visible
        in the video and/or from the environment heard in the audio.
        <br>
        <br>Consider how your background will look, and strive to set up an aesthetically-pleasing
        "scene":&#160;</p>
<ul>
        <li ="true"="">Clean and tidy, free of clutter</li>
        <li ="true"="">Simple, not busy: avoid excessive plants, photographs, or other attention-grabbing
          elements</li>
        <li ="true"="">Sufficient separation between you and the wall behind you</li>
        <li ="true"="">Use lamps and lighting to separate the foreground from the background</li>
        <li ="true"="">If available (or via ODL), use an external camera with settings for depth of field
          to defocus the background</li>
      </ul>
<p>Likewise, background noise captured during recording can detract from the overall
        quality of the recording. This includes humming or buzzing lights, noisy air handlers,
        and other external noise. Some sources are beyond your control, but others can be
        minimized or eliminated.</p>

<p>Regardless of whether you are using a laptop camera or an external camera, its placement
        in relation to you is an important consideration.</p>
<ul>
        <li ="true"="">Camera placement should be just below eye level</li>
        <li ="true"="">If you are using a laptop, elevate it using a stand or pile of books to get a more
          professional camera angle</li>
        <li ="true"="">If you are using an external camera (cellphone, dedicated DSLR, or video camera),
          use a tripod to maintain the height and angle and to eliminate handheld-imparted
          motion</li>
      </ul>

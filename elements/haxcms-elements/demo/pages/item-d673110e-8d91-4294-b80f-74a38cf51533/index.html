This enables <abbr data-hax-layout="true" title="Platform as a Service">PaaS</abbr> and <abbr data-hax-layout="true" title="Software as a Service">SaaS</abbr> style implementations of HAX. For example, if you are affiliated with Penn State, you can log into hax.psu.edu and it automatically generates you a copy of HAXcms to build and maintain your own sites. That's a SaaS implementation of the HAX ecosystem.</p>

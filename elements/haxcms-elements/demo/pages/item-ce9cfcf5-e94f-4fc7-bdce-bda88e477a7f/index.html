<p>Much in the same vein as <a href="welcome/community/pillars/free-and-open">Free and Open</a>, HAX will seek to maximize remix-ability of the platform and anything released in pursuit of the Ubiquitous Web. Users of HAX tools whether it be outline designer, h-a-x editor, CMS, CLI or web-GUI, should be able to remix and rapidly prototype / experiment with solutions in order to craft the best possible option in the least amount of time possible. Some may call this usability; but to HAX, usability is the water in which we swim.</p>

<ul><li>Usability: Anywhere there are two or more physical user operations (click, scroll, eye position, type, etc) let us seek to reduce this to one or happen automatically</li><li>Content always in a free, open, semantic, remixable format (HTML / web components)</li><li>Web platform usage of core browser APIs in order to maximize compatibility across the web</li><li>Unbundled pieces on site output in order to allow greater remix, removal and adding of other pieces</li><li>One click migrations, forking, manipulation and combining of site structure and media</li><li>Outline designer focused on rapid experimentation</li><li>Block definitions are traced to single web components and are freely available</li><li>Extensibility to build on top of other components that already exist (see <a href="welcome/community/pillars/extensibility">Extensibility</a>)</li><li>Open licensing stored with site content (site.json) in order to maintain remixability across the web ecosystem</li><li>Open licensing for source code to maximize portability and remix across ecosystem</li><li>Hot-swappable themes to enable developers to test designs and create flexible templates for rendering static structures</li></ul>

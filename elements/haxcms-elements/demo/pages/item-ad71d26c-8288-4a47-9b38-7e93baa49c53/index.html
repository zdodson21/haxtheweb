<p>We made tooling to publish web component monorepos with ease and in any library. It's called WCFactory and while not required, it's the tooling we use for managing our monorepo. We highly recommend you check out the <a href="documentation/developers/tools/create" target="_blank">HAX CLI</a> as that's a more modern and simplified version of WCFactory.</p>
<p>A factory churns out web components in a library agnostic way so that you can create and manage your own web component library while distributing them on npm as individual packages.</p>

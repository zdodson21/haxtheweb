<block-quote citation="Annie Hughes | Statewide Coordinator | Invent Penn State LaunchBox &amp; Innovation Network" accent-color="grey"><p data-font-family="navigation" data-font-weight="light"><span>We reached out to HAX while searching for a platform to develop Customer Discovery 101, a new entrepreneurship training program available to the public. We were running into challenges finding systems that were flexible and customizable and also accessible for our end users. Our team had limited design experience and so needed an LMS that was user-friendly and intuitive.</span></p></block-quote>
<p>Annie continues, "<span>We worked with the HAX team throughout our end-to-end development process. Not only was the system easy to use, but the HAX team provided exceptional support as we built and customized our program. The system made building a multi-media training program simple and the design templates significantly reduced the time and skill required to design the interface. The HAX team went out of their way to respond to our questions and requests for support. </span><span>Now launched, our program has received overwhelmingly positive reviews from our users for both functionality and design. We plan to continue working with HAX for development of our future programs."</span></p>

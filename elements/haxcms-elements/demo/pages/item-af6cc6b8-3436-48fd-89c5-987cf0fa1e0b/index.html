<p>Example of HAX element schema JSON object. It's a pretty simple abstraction of HTML
  elements that helps with packaging and sanitation. This is effectively HAX version
  of a <abbr title="Virtual Document Object Model">VDOM</abbr> in which all elements
  in the page must be converted into HAXElement Schema in order to get in and out of
  the DOM that HAX is controlling.</p>

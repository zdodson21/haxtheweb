<p>Platform Agnostic means that HAX technologies will work anywhere. They can work stand alone in the case of HAXsites like this one, as part of a larger solution like HAXcms or HAXiam, on static web pages, codepen's, Drupal, Wordpress, custom CMS's, it doesn't matter. HAX should work there. The web component standard makes this technically possible, and the way in which we implement that standard helps us maximize integration and ease of adoption by existing and future solutions.</p>
